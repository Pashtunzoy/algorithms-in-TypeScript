# Algorithms in TypeScript

## Implimenting some famous algorithms in Typescript for both practice of Typescript and Algorithms solving.

### Stack Used
* TypeScript -> for main implementation of Algorithsm
* Tape -> for TDD of all the Algorithms

### Some of the Already Implemented Algoritms
* Selection Sort
* Quick Sort
* Binary Search
* Breadth First Search(BFS)
* Dijkstra(WIP)
* Greedy Algorithm(WIP)
